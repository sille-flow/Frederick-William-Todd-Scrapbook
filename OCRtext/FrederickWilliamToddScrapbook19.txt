Remarkable Cypresses. Perhaps the oldest tree of which there is any record
in the world is the cypress of Soma, or Somma, in Lombardy. This celebrated
tree, of which fig. 2325. is a portrait (from an original drawing kindly sent to us
by Signor Manetti of Monza), is generally supposed to have been planted the
year of the birth of Jesus Christ, and on this account is treated with great re-
verence by the inhabitants of that part of Lombardy where it grows; but the
Abbé Berléze informs us there is an ancient chronicle extant at Milan, which
proves that it was a tree in the time of Julius Cesar, B. c. 42. (See p. 169.)
