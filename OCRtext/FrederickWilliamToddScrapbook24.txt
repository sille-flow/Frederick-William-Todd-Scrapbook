Peel's Irish Crop

Whatever may have been the general result of the harvest, we cannot congratulate Peel on the state of his Irish Crops, which have turned out quite the reverse of what he had been sowing for. He had thrown the seeds of conciliation broadcast in all directions, and he had dibbled in a quantity of blarney; but though he had enriched the ground with soft soap and treasury guano, repeal caps, and some still more objectable fruit had been the result of his labours. His Maynooth house-warming scheme has ended only in hot water pouring about him in every direction, and even the very orange blossoms, in which he once took pride, have a number of thorns about them.
