I made the choices to include ID, File Name, Caption, Description, and Left or Right Page. I included these because they contain all of the information I can determine from the images. ID uniquely identifies the file. File Name gives me reference to what the file is. Caption is a short description giving context to the file. Description gives a substitution for the page, which typically just has a picture. Left or right page includes information about the structure of the book.

For extracting text, I used OCR through tesseract. This method produced a great deal of errors. The most errors were seen with text that was closer to handwritten or cursive and pictures that were sideways or upside down. For those images, none of the text was correctly extracted. For the other images that had upright print, there were varying amounts of correctness, though even the best still had random character before and after the texts. Additionally, unusual structures posed a big problem, with table-ish and two column pages giving a load of problems. None of the images I believe were transcribed, though that may have been the gibberish I deleted. The only page that I didn't have to correct at all was a page with no text, resulting in an empty text document.
