I made the choices to include ID, File Name, Caption, Description, and Left or Right Page. I included these because they contain all of the information I can determine from the images. ID uniquely identifies the file. File Name gives me reference to what the file is. Caption is a short description giving context to the file. Description gives a substitution for the page, which typically just has a picture. Left or right page includes information about the structure of the book.
